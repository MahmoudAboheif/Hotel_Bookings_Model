# Hotel Bookings Project

This project is part of GTC ML Project 1.  
The goal is to clean and preprocess the hotel_bookings dataset so it can be used to build a machine learning model that predicts booking cancellations.

## Contents
- hotel_bookings_project.ipynb → Notebook with data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing steps
- hotel_bookings.csv → Original dataset
- README.md → Project description

## Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning (missing values, duplicates, outliers, data types)
3. Feature Engineering (new features, encoding, removing leakage)
4. Train-Test Split
